## What the project is
This project allows users to create or login to an existing account by storing information into a csv file. 

Once they have successfully authenticated, they are taken to the start game screen where you can play either 
a Tic-Tac-Toe game locally (human vs. human on same computer) or by a server-client 
(human vs. human on separate computers connected to the same server).

## How to run the project
You can easily run this project by using the command in terminal:
```
gradle run
```

Or, alternatively, you can build the project by creating a run configuration under the application option utilizing the Java SDK.
